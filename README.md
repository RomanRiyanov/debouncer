> **A Debounce function is a higher-order function that returns another function, to create closure around the function parameters (func, timeout) and the timer variable. Timeout: The amount of time you want the debounce function to wait after the last received action before executing func.**

This tiny piece of code was inspired by [Trey Huffine article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/debounce-in-javascript-improve-your-applications-performance-5b01855e086/ "Trey Huffine article")

Implemented with vanilla JS.
